## Description

A console program was created to assist Martian visitors in locating their valuable cargo buried along their path on Earth. The Martians, in need of spare parts for their malfunctioning spaceship, buried their cargo in three boxes of varying sizes along a 7-kilometer path towards the nearest city. The cargo totaled 713 kilograms and was strategically buried with markers indicating distance and weight.

The program utilizes one-dimensional arrays to input kilometer markers where the cargo might be buried. However, there's a twist - the boxes possess tentacle-like legs that relocate them to new hiding spots if the entered kilometer markers are incorrect. The program prompts for three markers sequentially, verifying the presence of cargo at each point. If the weight of the found boxes doesn't sum up to 713 kilograms, the process repeats until the correct markers are input.
### While working on this task, I learnt:

**One-dimensional arrays:** utilized arrays to store and manage the weights and locations of the cargo boxes

**Conditional segments and loops:** employed conditional statements and loops to validate user input, check caro presence, and manage box movements

**Git:** gained proficiency in Git basics, including 'git add' to stage changes, 'git commit' to record changes with descriptive messages, 'git push' to upload changes to the GitHub into remote repository

**GitHub:** learned how to create remote repository in GitHub's UI, how to track issues and efficient project management

### Technologies used:
**Random module:** used the Python standard library to generate random box locations for the cargo

**Git:** managed project versions, viewed tracking changes
