#Chocolate bar has the form of a rectangle divided into nÃ—m portions.
#Chocolate bar can be split into two rectangular parts by breaking it along a selected straight line on its pattern.
#Determine whether it is possible to split it so that one of the parts will have exactly k squares.
#The program reads three integers: n, m, and k. It should print YES or NO.
n = int(input())

if k > nm or k % n != 0 and k % m != 0:
    print('NO')
